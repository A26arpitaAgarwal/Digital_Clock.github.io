# Digital Clock Project
The Digital Clock Project is a simple JavaScript application that displays a real-time digital clock on a webpage. This project demonstrates how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript to create an interactive clock display.

## Introduction
The Digital Clock Project showcases how to build a digital clock using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic updates. The clock continuously updates to display the current time and offers an example of using JavaScript's `setInterval` function for regular updates.

## Features
- Real-time display of the current time.
- Continuous updates every second.
- Minimalistic and user-friendly design.
